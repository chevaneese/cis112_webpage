					<h2> My Dime Not Yours</h2>
					<p> My dime was lost a few years ago. How? I don't know. My pockets did not have holes. My handbag had a zipper. My purse was not old. However, I lost my dime. Did you lose your dime too?</p>

					<p>I lost my dollar over a decade ago. How? I spent it on things that others enjoy more than I did.
					Here are a few products that I lost my dollars in that we call Vending Machine:
					<ul>
						<li>taking a photo in Photo booth, and </li>
						<li>getting soda from a drinks machine</li>
						<li>And let's not forget a snack machine.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Vending Machine gets satisfation eating dollars; if you read it's instructions carefully it reads, <q>feed dollar bill here</q>.
					<p>Okay so this website requires me to build content. This is my story and I am sticking to it!  Thank you for your attention.</p>
