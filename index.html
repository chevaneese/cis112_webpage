			<h2>My Dime</h2>
				<h3> My Dime and Not Yours</h3>
					<p> My dime was lost a few years ago. How? I don't know.</p>
					<blockquote>I am baffled because
					<ul>
						<li>My pockets did not have holes.</li> 
						<li>My handbag had a zipper.</li> 
						<li>My purse is new.</li>
					</ul>
					</blockquote>
					<p>However, I lost my dime. Did you lose your dime too?</p>
		    			
     		<h2> My Quarter</h2>
				<h3>My Quarter Not Yours</h3>
					<p>I lost my quarter few years back. How? I lost it to the meter. It requires me to feed it every second in a minute from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
					<blockquote>Meter Pricing: 
					<ul>
						<li>$.05 for 5 seconds</li>
						<li>$.10 for 10 seconds</li> 
						<li>$.25 for 30 seconds</li>
					</ul>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Did you lose your quarter too?</p>
			<h2> My Dollar</p>
				<h3>My Dollar Is Not Wasted</h3>
					<p> I lost my dollar over a decade ago. How? I spent it on things that others enjoy more than I did.</p>
					<blockquote>Talk about a few products I would like to avoid, 
					<ul>
						<li>photo booth</li>
						<li>vending machine</li>
					</ul>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Why? Do you notice these items eat money? <cite>insert here</cite>. These vending machine eat money. They politely tell you to <cite>insert dollar here</cite>.</p>
					<p>Did you spend your dollar too?</p>
